# Virtual operating system

A simple virtual operating system written in python. (Under development). Currently, the following commands are supported:  

| Command | Usage | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `echo` | To print content on screen | `cd <your content here>` | `cd Hello Virtual operating system!` |
| `cd` | To change current working directory | `cd <your dir here>` | `cd ../` |
| `dir` | To list all files and folders in a directory | `dir` to list all files and folders in current working directory, `dir <path to parent directory>` to look for files in another directory | `dir`, `dir ../` |
| `shutdown` | To shutdown the virtual operating system | `shutdown` | `shutdown` |

I am adding more commands! If you would like a command to be added, feel free to open an issue for that! While you wait for virtual os to be completed, check my other interesting projects:
